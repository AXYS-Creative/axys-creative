    - title: "Why wouldn't I just hire in-house?"
      content: "To save money. The average annual salary for designers and developers often exceeds $100,000 (roughly $8,000 per month) plus benefits. In our model you’re paying a fraction of the cost. Plus, with the flexibility to pause or cancel your plan at any time means you're only paying for what you need when you need it."
    - title: "What happens after I sign up?"
      content: "Within minutes of signing up, we'll issue an intro email containing a link to your <a class='btn-type--underline btn--split-text tab-element-page' href='https://trello.com'>Trello</a> board. This board will be our primary means of communication, task tracking, and request handling. After creating the board, we'll send you the link so you can start adding requests immediately. Typically, we begin working on these requests on the same day."
